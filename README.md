## Generative Models

Figure 3 and Figure33 are the outputs of random noise and the training losses curves under the hyperparameters, learning rate equals to 2e-4 and the latent vector size is 3.
Figure 1 and Figure11: learning rate = 2e-4, latent vector size = 10/
Figure 2 and Figure22: learning rate = 2e-8, latent vector size = 10 which implies model collapes
