## Generative Models

Figure 3 and Figure33 are the outputs of random noise and the training losses curves under the hyperparameters, learning rate equals to 2e-4 and the latent vector size is 3. Due to the similar outputs generated from the random noises, model collapses;<br/>
Figure 1 and Figure11: learning rate = 2e-4, latent vector size = 10; <br/>
Figure 2 and Figure22: learning rate = 2e-8, latent vector size = 10 which implies model collapes; <br/>
Figure 4 and Figure44: learning rate = 2e-4, latent vector size = 10 under the architecture which includes 5 convolution layers in the generator and 4 convolution layers in the discriminator. And in this architecture, model is collapse.</br>
